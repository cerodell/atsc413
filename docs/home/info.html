    <h3>Rationale&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
      Wildfire hazards are increasingly threatening people living near the urban/forest interface. These threats are exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and forest-fire-suppression practices.</p>
<p>      ATSC 413 is designed to educate highly qualified personnel with the technical skill-set to forecast forest-fire weather, to anticipate evolution of fire hazards associated with a changing climate, and to advise on sustainable fire-mitigation policies.</p>
<p>      Although a large portion of this new course will still be on synoptics (i.e., weather forecasting), its focus will be application to wildfires.  Students in ATSC 413 will learn how to interpret, communicate, and apply modern numerical weather prediction (NWP)-based forecasting (Bauer et al 2022) to fire-weather issues.</p>
      The synoptics covered in the proposed course will partially satisfy the synoptic/weather-forecasting portion of World Meteorological Organization professional meteorologist requirements. It will also partly satisfy the synoptics requirements for graduates applying for meteorologist jobs with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and helps to satisfy the American Meteorological Society requirements for a meteorology bachelor&rsquo;s degree. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Intended Audience&nbsp;</h3>
<p>• ATSC majors &amp; honours. <br>
• ATSC minors <br>
• Combined ATSC/CPSC majors<br>
• Physical GEOG majors (a technical elective)<br>
• Environmental Science (could be listed as an elective)<br>
• Forestry students (could be listed as an elective)<br>
• Other interested students with STEM backgrounds who have the prereqs.<br>
• Fire fighters &amp; managers (would be a re-training opportunity for them, but only if it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with their normal job schedule)</p>
